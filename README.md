# Image Processing Toolkit

Welcome to the **Image Processing Toolkit**! This repository contains a diverse collection of image processing projects designed to demonstrate various techniques and applications in the field of computer vision. Each project harnesses the power of **Python** and **OpenCV** to tackle common image manipulation tasks.

## Project Overview

The toolkit includes the following key features:

- **Creative Image Filters:** Dive into a world of creativity with an array of image effects. This feature allows users to apply filters such as Grayscale, Cartoon, Blurred, Sharpened, and many more, including unique effects like thermal vision, watercolor, cinematic, pencil sketch, lomo, and rainbow. 

- **Edge Detection:** Understand and visualize the boundaries within images using fundamental edge detection techniques. This project implements several algorithms, including Canny, Sobel, Laplacian, Kirsch, Robinson, Prewitt, and Roberts, enabling users to extract edges and enhance image features.

- **Face & Eye Detection:** Utilize **Haar cascades** to detect faces and eyes within images. This functionality is essential for applications in facial recognition and security systems, providing an effective tool for identifying key features in photos.

- **Image Colorization:** Bring life to grayscale images through deep learning techniques. This feature leverages a pre-trained model to transform black-and-white photographs into vibrant, colorful images, enhancing visual storytelling.

- **Image Compression:** Efficiently compress and convert images while maintaining quality. Users can adjust the compression level, select output formats, and even resize images through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies the processing workflow.

- **Image Steganography:** Explore the intriguing realm of steganography by encoding and decoding hidden messages within images. This project employs the Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding technique to securely embed messages, enhancing digital communication with a layer of secrecy.

- **Image to Pencil Sketch:** Convert your photos into artistic pencil sketches. This feature employs OpenCV to apply a simple yet effective algorithm, transforming images into hand-drawn representations for a unique artistic flair.

- **Image Watermarking:** Safeguard your images by adding watermarks using the **Pillow** library (PIL). This functionality allows users to incorporate branding or copyright notices directly into their images, ensuring protection against unauthorized use.
